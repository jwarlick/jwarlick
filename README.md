### Why hello there! üëã

I'm John Warlick. I'd describe myself as a data scientist with a taste for customer analytics and product analytics, but I enjoy using data to solve problems of any shape. I also like digging into data just for fun, which is a big part of why I've transitioned into this career path after being a creative technician in the music industry.

As of January 2022, I've just graduated from the UCLA Anderson School of Management's Master of Science in Data Analytics program with distinction. Big milestone! I also recently finished a 6-month Data Science internship at NBCUniversal.

I'm in the process of uploading data science projects from the past year, so if you're reading this sentence, check back soon!

### A little more about me:
- üë¨‚ÄÉI identify as L**G**BTQ (Pronouns: he/him) 
- üöÄ‚ÄÉMy third obsession (after data and media) is space, which might explain my profile picture
- üëØ‚ÄÉI'm a twin (shout out to my sister Rebecca)
- üè•‚ÄÉI'm very, very close to having beaten thyroid cancer (shout out to the Cedars-Sinai medical community)
- üéº‚ÄÉI still make, work on and write about music in my free time. Ask me about music and/or streaming!

### Data Science Projects
For ease of use, here are links to some data science projects I have hosted here and elsewhere:

[AutoGluon Exploration and Comparison](https://github.com/jwarlick/AutoGluon-Exploration-Spotify/blob/main/AutoGluon_Exploration_Spotify_v1-5.ipynb)
- Python project comparing efficacy of AutoML pipeline AutoGluon with other regressors for a regression task.
- Compares Random Forests, ExtraTrees Regressors, Linear Regression, and Convolutional Neural Networks.
- Employs Seaborn for various visualizations.

[Connecting and Interacting with the Spotify API without wrappers](https://github.com/jwarlick/Spotify-API-OAuth/blob/main/Spotify_API_connection-Anon.ipynb)
- Python project using an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow to connect to the Spotify API.
- Involves updating pre-existing data with data from API and basic data cleaning.

[Forecasting Spotify Streams](https://rpubs.com/johnwarlick/856265)
- R project comparing SES, ARIMA, and VAR/VECM modeling for forecasting Spotify Streams.
- Also involves Fourier seasonality estimation and visualization with ggplot2.

[Income Prediction](https://github.com/jwarlick/Income-Prediction/blob/main/ML%20Classification%20Project%20-%20Income%20Prediction.ipynb)
- Python project employing Logistic Regression, Standardization & One-Hot Encoding for a Classification task.

[Spotify Chart Research: Scraping, Visualization & Bootstrapping](https://github.com/jwarlick/Spotify-Chart-Analysis/blob/main/Spotify_Scraping_DataExploration_Visualization_Bootstrapping.ipynb)
- Python/SQL project using Requests / BeautifulSoup for data mining. Bootstrapping used to prove weekly streaming hypothesis.
- Uses TKCalendar and Matplotlib for visualization tools, and SQLAlchemy for database/schema engineering within Python.

[Wine Quality Prediction](https://github.com/jwarlick/Wine-Quality-Prediction/blob/main/ML%20Classification%20Project%20-%20Wine%20Quality.ipynb)
- Python project involving Decision Trees and Random Forests for a classification task.
- Involves feature transformation, hyperparameter tuning with GridSearch, and Seaborn visualizations.
