### Why hello there! 👋

I'm John Warlick. I'd describe myself as a data analyst with interests in content analytics, optimization and user analytics, but I enjoy using data to solve problems of any shape. I also like digging into data just for fun, which is a big part of why I've switched into this career from being a creative in the music industry.

I currently attend the UCLA Anderson School of Management's Master of Science in Data Analytics program, where I'm in the Class of 2021.

### Things I'm working on (watch this space!):

- An anonymized version of a data visualization / business intelligence project for industry
- A recommendation system project for music streaming 

### A little more about me:
- 👬 I identify as L**G**BTQ. (Pronouns: he/him) 
- 🏥 I'm _very_ close to having beaten thyroid cancer
- 👯 I'm a twin (shout out to my sister Rebecca)
- 🚀 My third obsession after data and music is space, which might explain my profile picture
- 🎼 I still make, work on and write about music in my free time. Ask me about music and/or streaming!
