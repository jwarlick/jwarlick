### Why hello there! 👋

I'm John Warlick. I'd describe myself as a data scientist with interests in content analytics, optimization and user analytics, but I enjoy using data to solve problems of any shape. I also like digging into data just for fun, which is a big part of why I've switched into this career from being a creative in the music industry.

I currently attend the UCLA Anderson School of Management's Master of Science in Data Analytics program, where I'm in the Class of 2021.

### Things I'm working on (watch this space!):
• An anonymized version of a data visualization / business intelligence project for industry</break>
• A recommendation system project for music streaming 

### A little more about me:
• 👬 I identify as L*G*BTQ. (Pronouns: he/him) </break>
• 🏥 I'm _very_ close to having beaten thyroid cancer</break>
• 👯 I'm a twin (shout out to my sister Rebecca)</break>
• 🎼 I still make, work on and write about music in my free time. Ask me about music and/or streaming!</break>
