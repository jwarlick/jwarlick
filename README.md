### Why hello there! 👋

I'm John Warlick. I'd describe myself as a data scientist with a taste for customer analytics and product analytics, but I enjoy using data to solve problems of any shape. I also like digging into data just for fun, which is a big part of why I've transitioned into this career path after being a creative technician in the music industry.

As of January 2022, I've just graduated from the UCLA Anderson School of Management's Master of Science in Data Analytics program with distinction. Big milestone! I also recently finished a 6-month Data Science internship at NBCUniversal.

I'm in the process of uploading projects from the past year, so if you're reading this sentence, check back soon!

### A little more about me:
- 👬 I identify as L**G**BTQ (Pronouns: he/him) 
- 🚀 My third obsession (after data and media) is space, which might explain my profile picture
- 👯 I'm a twin (shout out to my sister Rebecca)
- 🏥 I'm a recent cancer survivor (shout out to the Cedars-Sinai medical community)
- 🎼 I still make, work on and write about music in my free time. Ask me about music and/or streaming!
