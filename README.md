### Why hello there! üëã

I'm John Warlick. I'd describe myself as a data scientist and analyst with a taste for customer analytics and product analytics, but I enjoy using data to solve problems of any shape. I also like digging into data just for fun, which is a big part of why I've transitioned into this career path after being a creative technician in the music industry.

Most of what I have on here are old student projects, but check back periodically-- one of these days I might upload something interesting!

### A little more about me:
- üë¨‚ÄÉI identify as L**G**BTQ (Pronouns: he/him) 
- üöÄ‚ÄÉMy third obsession (after data and media) is space, which might explain my profile picture
- üëØ‚ÄÉI'm a twin (shout out to my sister Rebecca)
- üè•‚ÄÉI'm very, very close to having beaten thyroid cancer (shout out to the Cedars-Sinai medical community)
- üéº‚ÄÉI still make, work on and write about music in my free time. Ask me about music and/or streaming!

- Short analysis comparing efficacy of AutoML pipeline AutoGluon with other regressors for a regression task.
- Compares Random Forests, ExtraTrees Regressors, Linear Regression, and Convolutional Neural Networks.
- Employs Seaborn for various visualizations.

[Connecting and Interacting with the Spotify API without wrappers](https://github.com/jwarlick/Spotify-API-OAuth/blob/main/Spotify_API_connection-Anon.ipynb)
- Steps to use Python with OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow to connect to the Spotify API.
- Involves updating pre-existing data with data from API and basic data cleaning.

[Forecasting Spotify Streams](https://rpubs.com/johnwarlick/856265)
- R project comparing SES, ARIMA, and VAR/VECM modeling for forecasting Spotify Streams.
- Also involves Fourier seasonality estimation and visualization with ggplot2.

[Spotify Chart Research: Scraping, Visualization & Bootstrapping](https://github.com/jwarlick/Spotify-Chart-Analysis/blob/main/Spotify_Scraping_DataExploration_Visualization_Bootstrapping.ipynb)
- Python/SQL project using Requests / BeautifulSoup for data mining. Bootstrapping used to prove weekly streaming hypothesis.
- Uses TKCalendar and Matplotlib for visualization tools, and SQLAlchemy for database/schema engineering within Python.
